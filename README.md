# scripts I wrote to make my life easier

### discord-border-fixer

This [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script waits for Discord's launch on startup and then enables the WS_THICKFRAME window style attribute on it. Enabling the WS_THICKFRAME attribute ensures that the Discord window cannot be resized when it is maximized. This is useful as it prevents accidentally resizing the Discord window when closing other maximized windows adjacent to it.

Please note that you will need to replace the coordinates and update the Discord.lnk path for the script to work.
